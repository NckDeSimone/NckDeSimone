- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick DeSimone

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java in Promineo Tech's Back End Bootcamp. I briefly was introduced to coding when I took a programming for engineers course in college. I had a great time learning the course material and always liked the problem solving aspect that programming requires. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making the jump from hobbyist to professional and am always working to better myself. Although I have a full time job in a completely unrelated field, I'm spending a great deal of my free time learning and relearning different aspects of programming. At some point, I hope to leverage these skills to find a career in the back end development industry. 

- ðŸ’¡ Any advice or feedback is welcome. I'm excited to see how the future unfolds!
